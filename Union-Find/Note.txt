QuickFind is too slow. In the worst case, it will cost quadratic time.
Need remember that you could touch everything in the main memory in about a second. (billions/sec)

Analysis of algorithm:
Avoid bugs => Perdict performance, compare algorithm, provide guarantees.
Principle:
1. reproducible experiments
2. falsifiable Hypotheses
